# DocVerify

**DocVerify** is a web-based application designed to assist mortgage brokers in pre-screening financial documents more efficiently. The project was developed as a capstone project by a team of Software Development students from SAIT, showcasing our skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, cloud integration, and AI-driven validation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

DocVerify leverages OCR, large language models (LLMs), and rule-based validation to scan documents like T4s and pay stubs, detecting inconsistencies such as missing signatures or irregular income declarations. This tool aims to improve document accuracy, reduce manual errors, and streamline the mortgage approval process.
